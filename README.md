## How to deploy to Apache

1. Download the deploy.sh script from the repository:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnquistLab/NSRweb/main/deploy.sh
```

2. For safety purposes, it is recommended to create a backup of the current version that has been deployed in the Apache folder.

3. Run the script with sudo:

```sh
sudo sh deploy.sh <apache folder>
```
